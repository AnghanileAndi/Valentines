# From Bunny — Jemima, will you be my Valentine?

This is a duplicate of the Valentine app modified to say "From Bunny" and to reveal an attached image with confetti when `Yes` is clicked.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — interaction logic
- `assets/bunny.jpg` — place your image here (not included)

Preview locally:

Open `index.html` directly, or run a simple HTTP server and open http://localhost:8000/index.html

Python 3:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

To make it live:
- Push this folder to a GitHub repo and enable Pages from `main` branch root, or use Vercel/Netlify.

Notes:
- Add your picture as `assets/bunny.jpg`. The page will show it when `Yes` is clicked and will fire confetti.
